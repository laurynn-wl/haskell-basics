# haskell-basics
This repository includes scripts demonstrating fundamental Haskell concepts: basic math operations, data types and functions, functional tasks involving list manipulations and recursion, and string processing through run-length encoding for compression and decompression.


## Basic Math Operations 
The ```basicMathOperation.hs``` script demonstrates basic function definitions and testing in GHCi, covering simple operations like doubling, finding the smallest or largest of two numbers, and calculating the difference between them. 

## Basic Types and Functions 
The ```basicTypesAndFunctions.hs``` script defines various functions and data structures, demonstrating basic list, tuple, and function manipulations, including type transformations, arithmetic operations, and helper functions for working with pairs and lists.

## Functional Tasks 
The ```functionalTasks.hs``` script demonstrates list manipulation, logical XOR, grid generation, and mathematical operations like sum of squares and GCD calculation, using recursion and pattern matching.

## String Processing 
The ```stringProcessing.hs``` script provides functions for compressing and decompressing strings using run-length encoding, including functions to encode repeated characters, flatten data into a compressed form, and then decode and expand it back to its original form.
